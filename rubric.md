## Front-End Design (10 pts)

_____ 2 pts: The user can easily to encode and decode using HuffmanCode class. The user does not need create any new instance of other classes (e.g. Tree, Node) to be able to use HuffmanCode to generate code.

_____ 2 pts: Submission includes a **cheat sheet** (`cheatsheet.md`) documenting the proper process to encode and decode a .txt file.

_____ 5 pts: The algorithm works weel: the decoded message is the same as the encoded message

_____ 1 pt: The program has appropriate way to handle mis-operation (e.g. it will throw exception if user jumps to generate code without building a tree)


## Back-End Design (10 pts)

_____ 2 pts: Selected classes(s) are **effective, efficient** at supporting the desired operations and program behavior.

_____ 2 pts: Design justification includes a discussion of at least one (reasonable) **alternative design** that could have been used, and the reasons why you decided against this alternative.

_____ 2 pts: The project makes effective use of **Java built-in classes** whenever they are appropriate.

_____ 2 pts: The project's design is **extensible** (i.e. someone else could pick up where you left off, adding on or modifying the game without requiring a total rewrite).

_____ 2 pts: Submission includes an **architecture diagram** describing the relationships between all classes.


## General Items (10 pts):
_____ 4 pts: Program compiles without errors or warnings.

_____ 2 pts: Executes fully & consistently without crashing (exception/freeze).

_____ 2 pt: Complies with style guidelines (missing items 1 pt each):

      _____ Classes & class members all have Javadoc header comments.

      _____ Clear and consistent indentation of bracketed sections.

      _____ Adheres to Java conventions on naming & capitalization.

      _____ Methods & variables all have clear and accurate names.

      _____ Methods avoid confusing side effects.

_____ 1 pt: All required files included with submission (including completed checklist file).

_____ 1 pt: `readme.md` contains your reflection on the project and responses to all prompts .
