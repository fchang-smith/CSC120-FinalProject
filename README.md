# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
The core of my project is to build and trace across a binary tree. To construct a tree, I create my own Node class as a date structure to store information required to make up a tree.
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 I found it is very interesting to build new class due to my requirement. Unlike homework, in which all classes we need to complete are set, in my own project, I need to figure out should I split one class into two or if it's better to putting all methods in one class. 
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 No.
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
 I would like to parse the words with more details. For now, "Hi" and "Hi!" are regarded as two words, instead of regarding as "Hi" and "!". This might make the final code less efficient in storing information. If I have time, I would try to seperate "Hi!" into "Hi" and "!".
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
 The most important feedback given by my dad is that I should try to build my own Node class, which enables me to be more familiar with the basic logic of my program.
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
 Try to plan ahead which method should achieve which functions. Do not write code before thinking thoroughly. 
 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
